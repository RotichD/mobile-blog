# Blog - Mobile App

## Description

    - React Native Mobile app that allows users to create, update, delete, and get blog posts.
    - I was motivated by my desire to learn React Native
    - I explored the concepts of statemanagement with React Hooks: useState, useContext, and userReducer.
    - I learned a great deal about functionality and implementation of a Reducer as well as how to integrate a REST API.

## Installation

Due to the narrow scope of this project, it is setup to use a local json server running through an ngrok tunnel. A separate json db is required. Change BaseURL in jsonServer.js to Ngrok temporary forwarding url.
